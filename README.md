youtube loader
==============

Significantly optimise video heavy page loading times by dynamically swapping out YouTube iframes with placeholder images, subsequently loading video iframes only when clicked.

Usage:

Requires jQuery. Include youtube-loader.js after jQuery in the footer of your html. Any YouTube iframes in the HTML will be replaced with placeholder images & a play button overlay. Clicking the play button will then dynamically substitute in the YouTube iframe and play the video as normal.
