youtube-loader
==============

Significantly optimise video heavy page loading times by dynamically swapping out YouTube iframes with placeholder images, subsequently loading video iframes only when clicked.

Usage:

Include youtube-loader.js after jQuery in the footer of your html. Any YouTube iframes in the HTML will be replaced with placeholder images. Clicking the play button will then dynamically substitute for the YouTube iframe and play the video as normal.
